# YearONE Assessment - Movie DB

#### Created a movie search API using The Movie Database API https://www.themoviedb.org . 
#### I used React.js, React hooks, and a Rails API for data persistence

## User Stories-
#### A user has the ability to search for a movie title, click on the movie searched, and view details on the movie.
#### User can like or dislike a film which is then saved in the database using Rails. 


## How To Play-
* Clone down this repo to your local computer
* Clone the backend API that is used for the application here => https://github.com/ChristyTropila/movie-db-backend
* Open up both repos in text editor of your choice
* In the rails api console run => bundle install, rake db:migrate => rails s -p 4000
* In the react app console run => bundle install
* The react app should start on localhost:3000 and the react app on localhost:4000
