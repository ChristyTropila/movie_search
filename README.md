# YearONE Assessment - Movie DB

## Created a movie search API using The Movie Database API https://www.themoviedb.org . 
## I used React.js, React hooks, and a Rails API for data persistence

## A user has the ability to search for a movie title, click on the movie searched, and view details on the movie.
## User can like or dislike a film which is then saved in the database using Rails.
